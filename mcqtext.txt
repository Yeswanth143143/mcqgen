One of the pioneers of intelligent computers was Alan Turing. Often credited with laying the foundational theory for modern computing, he proposed the concept of a machine that could simulate any other machine (the Turing Machine) in the 1930s. His famous Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, was a fundamental contribution to the field of AI, challenging whether machines could mimic human intelligence. However, it wasn’t until 1955 that John McCarthy founded AI as an academic discipline and called it “artificial intelligence.” He also developed a programming language called LISP in the late 1950s, which became crucial to AI development.

Deep learning started to develop in the 1990s as researchers began creating early versions of deep learning algorithms, which were initially limited by the need for greater computational power. Then, in 1997, AI won during a chess game. This victory of IBM’s Deep Blue over world chess champion Garry Kasparov was a landmark moment, demonstrating AI's capabilities in mastering complex strategic games that involve deep logical and strategic thinking.

The 1990s were pivotal for AI as more datasets were available, and internet technologies allowed the sharing of datasets for machine learning. The 2000s were even more phenomenal for AI. With more data and computing power, machine learning techniques flourished and assisted in web searches, online ads, and spam filtering, dramatically improving user experiences and system efficiencies.
